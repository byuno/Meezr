### Welcome to Meez'r! 

Meez'r is a website designed by Bobby Uno, Richard Liao, and Pratik Bassi to share, store, and understand the nutritional content of the recipes you have!
The project was built with Javascript, React, Ruby on Rails, PostgresSQL, ElephantSQL, and Material UI.

If you are interested in using this website, please fork it then clone it - you will then need to sign up for ElephantSQL and create your own .env file with your secret URL.
